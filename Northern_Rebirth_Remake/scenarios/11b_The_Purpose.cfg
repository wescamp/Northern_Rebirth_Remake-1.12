            story= _ "Shortly after leaving the valley Tallin's scout returned with news. The Information was indeed interesting. Not so far from there, in a place known as Fangrock, there was an imprisoned sorceress. In fact she was the princess Eryssa. The Marshal of the destroyed army, Hidel, was on a mission to rescue her by force or paying a ransom. However now his only option was to trade the gold for the princess's freedom since all what was left from his troops was a small group of elves sent for reconnaissance."

This is what had to be done to fulfill the purpose. This weird behavior made them unable to bring justice. On the other hand the living had feelings... This approach could be used to his advantage, bypassing the fame of his dreadful name."
